## Features  
- Passive rimless wheel dynamics on an inclined plane  
- Torque and energy computations  
- Animated visualization (inclined + straight views)  
- GIF/MP4 export support  

## Requirements  
- MATLAB (R2018a or newer)  
- No additional toolboxes needed  

## How to Run  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajanprasad460/RimLessWheel.git
   ```
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project folder.  
3. Run:
